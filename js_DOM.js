This file explores the Document Object Model

DOM: The W3C Document Object Model is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and
update the content, structure, and style of a document. The DOM interface defines HTML elements as objects, properties of all HTML elements,
methods to access all HTML elements, and events for all HTML elements.

DOM navigation: An HTML page is represented as a node tree with the document itself as the root of the tree.


Nodes: There are 6 different types of nodes in the DOM. These are the document node, root node, element node, text node, attribute node, and
comment node.

Document node: This is the entire document.

Root node: This is the <html> tag.

Element node: Every HTML element.

Text node: text inside HTML.

Attribute node: Every HTML attribute.

Comment node: All comments in the document.


DOM and JavaScript: JavaScript uses the DOM as a model or notion of web pages, HTML documents, XML documents, and there component
parts(elements). Every element in a document is part of the Document Object Model for that document and can be accessed and manipulated
using the DOM and a scripting language like JavaScript.

Basic DOM tasks: Querying DOM, modifying DOM elements, modifying classes and attributes, listening to events, and animation.
